# IBM-Machine-Learning

In this assignment we have to make a 4 classifier algorithms which is:

1. KNN (K-Nearest Neighbor)
2. Decision Tree
3. Suport Vector Machine (SVM)
4. Logistic Regression

We are not just make a classifier from those algorithms, but we are also have to find the best accuracy from each algorithms, therfore we need to tune each of those algorithms to find the best accuracy and best classification models.

After we find the best model from each algorithms, we need to evaluate them. In this case we use 3 evaluation metrics:

1. Jaccard Score
2. F1 Score
3. Log Loss
